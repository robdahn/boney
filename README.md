## Introduction 
 
The increasing interest in the bone-brain crosstalk suggests the implication of bone metabolism in mood, cognition, energy homeostasis, etc. ([Khrimian et al. 2017](10.1084/jem.20171320); [Nakamura, Imaoka, and Takeda 2021](https://doi.org/10.1080/00207454.2020.1770247) ; [Obri et al. 2018](10.1038/nrendo.2017.181); [Rousseaud et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1515/hmbci-2016-0030)). Furthermore, low bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis have been associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease ([Kostev, Hadji, and Jacob 2018](https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-180569); [Zhang et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2022.07.012); [Xiao et al. 2023](10.1212/WNL.0000000000207220)). However, the BMD measures are typically not available in open-source brain imaging databases, such as IXI, ADNI, AIBL, OASIS, etc. We therefore decided to extract a proxy measure for head BMD from the skull. 


## Quick method
To extract bone parameters from MRI data, we use a refined SPM tissue segmentation procedure and derive different cranial intensity and thickness measures that can be used to approximate the head BMD measure.
An estimation of the head's skin-fold (subcutaneous fat thickness) is also available and can be used as an additional information to the typically available BMI measure.


## Quick start
Install Matlab/Octave, [SPM12](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) and its [CAT12](http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat) toolbox.
Download the zip-file and unpack it into your SPM12 toolbox directory. 

Run SPM and open the toolbox:

<code>spm fmri; spm_boney;</code>

Open the bone processing batch: 

![Image of the Boney menu and the bone-processing-batch](images/Boney_toolbox.png "Shown is the bone-processing batch that can be used to extract processed bone measures into a CSV table.")

and select the structural images that should be processed (currently supported are only T1-weighted images *without* fat suppression). Adapt relevant parameters (see paragraph Parameters and SPM batch help) and start the processing. Voilà! 

After the processing has finished, you can use the XML2CSV batch to extract the estimated (bone) values for further analyses.



## Parameters
Furthermore, you can specify which output files to write, e.g., the short bone-report (as a JPG), or the processed NIFTI volumes or GIFTI surfaces that are also shown in the bone-report.

![Image of the bone atlas and mask](images/KADA_regions_mask.png "Shown is the bone atlas and the bone mask.")


## Results
Boney writes a report file and a mat file that include all processed values for each individual. The most important measures are prompted on the command line while processing. The parameters are grouped by processing aspects listed in table #.  The T* parameters are derived from SPM/CAT preprocessing and provide important information about the given MRI input. We estimate thickness (th) or intensity parameters, which can be volume- or surface-based (v/s) in the masked occipital region of the head (H), bone cortex (Bcor), bone marrow (Bmar), or full structure (see table). Intensity-based measures were normalized for CSF intensity but depend strongly on the protocol.

|  1 | Tw         | MRI image weighting (T1w, T2w, PDw, MTw, IRw) |
|  2 | Tbg        | Backgound intensity (e.g. low in MPRage, high in many MP2Rage, MT, R1 protocols |
|  3 | Tfat       | Use of fat suppression protocol that reduces the bone (marrow) intensity | 
|  4 | Tres       | RMS resolution quality measure, i.e. weighted-average resolution in mm (lower=better) | 
|  5 | Tcnr       | Contrast-to-noise ratio to roughly quantify image quality and the presence of motion artifacts (lower=better)|
|  6 | v/sBmar    | Volume/surface-based bone marrow measure |
|  7 | v/sBcor    | Volume/surface-based bone cortex measure (~bone mineral density) | 
|  8 | v/sBth     | Volume/surface-based bone thickness (diploë and cortex) |
|  9 | v/sHth     | Volume/surface-based head thickness (fat and muscles) |
| 10 | v/sHmed    | Volume/surface-based head intensity (median of all voxel-values, protocol dependent!) |
| 11 | Tbcor      | SPM-based bone cortex intensity - the minimum of the typically 3 Gaussians of the unified segmentation (basic measure only for debugging/tests/comparison) |
| 12 | Tbmar      | SPM-based bone cortex intensity - the maximum of the typically 3 Gaussians of the unified segmentation (basic measure only for debugging/tests/comparison) |
| 13 | Tbdns      | SPM-based bone density - volume-ratio between SPM minimum and median Gaussian (expert, only for comparison) |
| 14 | Tmed(c)    | Volume-based (classic) median bone intensity of the corrected bone (expert, only for comparison) |


In addition, a csv-table of the most relevant measures (including brain tissue volumes) is created at the end of the processing. The csv-export batch can be used to create independent table of previously processed data by selecting the XML-reports of interest.

## Validation

*for the updated validation see the [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.22.595163)

The figure shows the results for the selected bone measures estimated on a UKB subsample created by the evaluation scripts.
The most relevant regional bone measures are (i) the occipital surface-based bone cortex estimate *sROI_bonecortex3*, (ii) the occipital volume-based bone marrow estimate *vROI_bonemarrow3*, and the *bone mineral density estimate* (BMD) that show a high correlation to the UKB BMD measures.

In addition, the estimated head fat measure is supported by high correlations with visceral adipose tissue (VAT), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ASAT), body fat percentage, BMI, and waist measurements of the UKB.
